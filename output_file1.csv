It's a long-term commitment. You're going to be spending almost every day driving it, for many years to come. So, it's important that you don't get just any car, but one with which you really click. Nalley Acura will take the time to get to know what you want, and work with you to ensure that's exactly what you have when you leave. That holds just as true for used car customers as it does for new Acura customers. If you want to be pressured into a purchase, you had best go elsewhere.

Nucar Pre-Owned Superstore (formerly AutoNorth Pre-Owned Superstore) in Gorham, NH was founded in late 2009 by Shawn Hanlon. Shawn had previously worked in the car business for many years as General Manager of the Berlin City Auto Group, under the leadership of Dan Dagesse. In 2020, Dan, his son Chris and Shawn went on to form the Nucar Automotive Group in NH with locations in Gorham, Tilton and Plymouth, Shawn serving as its President. In the beginning he began recruiting an exceptional team of friendly professionals, with the sole purpose of providing the finest automobile purchasing and service experience available anywhere. His goal was simple. Focus on the customer! Shawn is local to the area, living in Gorham. Each employee has been specifically chosen to represent Nucar Pre-Owned Superstore due to the common attributes of his or her positive attitude, knowledge and commitment to the highest standards of integrity.

Reviews: * Eye-catching styling; powerful engines, particularly the turbo engine in the SX trim; sporty handling; good value; generous warranty. Source: Edmunds * Good things come in perfectly sized packages, including the Kia Sportage. It delivers key performance benefits of a crossover, including agile, sporty handling, while four wheel independent suspension provides a remarkably smooth and comfortable ride. The Sportage is roomy and versatile, and the comfortable seats reconfigure for abundant cargo space. A dramatically designed tilt-and-slide panoramic sunroof is also available, and it extends along the length of the roof for you to enjoy big-sky views. Sportage LX and EX provide strong acceleration, thanks to their 182hp engine. Sportage SX, with a turbocharged 260hp 2.0L Gasoline Direct Injection engine, delivers even more driving excitement. An available 6-speed automatic transmission provides smooth, virtually seamless shifting. Its Sportmatic design allows you to choose the automatic mode or, for a sportier driving experience, clutch-free manual shifting. Sportage provides spacious seating for five adults. It has an available power driver's seat with lumbar support and, for your comfort as well as your front passenger's, available dual-zone temperature control with an advanced, ionized air-filtration system that provides purified air. Available features include heated front seats, a ventilated driver's seat, SiriusXM Traffic, a Smart Key that lets you unlock the door and start the engine with the key in your pocket, and the innovative UVO infotainment system which lets you use your compatible cell phone to make hands-free calls, receive and respond to text messages, listen to streaming audio, enjoy your personal music, and play your favorite song all by giving a single voice command.

Reviews: * If you want Jeep off-road capabilities in your small SUV and are willing to sacrifice a little room to get them, the Cherokee is for you. Source: KBB.com * Smooth and refined V6 engine; pleasant ride; spacious passenger quarters; availability of high-end tech features; Trailhawk offers unique off-road capability for the segment. Source: Edmunds * It is time you were re-introduced to the Jeep Cherokee. For 2014, this famed icon has been re-engineered from the ground up, with improved sophistication, styling and technology. The body of the Cherokee has been re-sculpted, resulting in a cutting edge appearance that is aerodynamic as well. It features aggressively angled LED headlights, and a newly re-shaped rear tailgate with stunning curves. In the front, even the signature Jeep 7-slotted Grille has been give a modern refined look, but is still instantly recognizable. Standard on all models, is the impressive 2.4-Liter MultiAir2 Tigershark I4 engine with 184 Horsepower, and a 9-Speed Automatic Transmission. The Trailhawk model gives you the 9-Speed Transmission with Jeep Active Drive II, an Off-Road Suspension, and Hill Descent Control. Need extra power? No problem. All models, with the exception of the Sport, give you the option of going with the available 3.2-Liter Pentastar V6, with 271 hp. The Cherokee is available in both Front-Wheel Drive and Four-Wheel Drive Models, with seven trims between them. The interior is stylish and high-end, but with an attitude. It has hand-sculpted angles, incredible technology, materials that are high quality, and more than anything else...comfort. Experience the feel of the bucket seats that are designed to make all your drives relaxing. Jeep also made sure that's its high-tech features like the various Uconnect systems were not only powerful, but easy to use as well. Plus, check out the hidden storage under floorboard in the back cargo area, or in the secret bin within the available fold-flat front passenger seat. Jeep has considered your safety as well with 4-wheel Anti-Lock brakes, Traction Control, and Electronic Roll Mitigation on all models.
